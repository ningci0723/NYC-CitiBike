# NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze bike-sharing data from Citibike in NYC for presentation to investors looking to begin a bike-sharing program, which will use Tableau to visualize the bike-sharing data. Using Tableau, we will create visualizations that show:

1. How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
2. How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
3. A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

Please find the Tableau story by using below link.

## Results

1. Based on the gender breakdown pie graph created, we can find that majority of the people who join the bikeshare program and use the bike are male and only around 1/4 are female.

2. Below map displays the bike start stations. The darkness of the blue indicate the relative number of trips started at those locations. It seems like the popular bike start locations are in the Lower Manhattan as there may be more towering office and residential buildings and using bike is more convenient than using a car or taxi.

3. Below graph shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.Based on the image, usually, the bikes will be used by riders within 40 minutes, of which most of the bikes will be checked out in 10 minutes.

4. Below graph shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders depending on different genders. Based on the image, usually, the bikes will be used by riders within 40 minutes, of which most of the bikes will be checked out in 10 minutes.

5. Below graph shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. We can see that the heavy bike usage during the weekday commute times which are around 8am in the morning and 5-6pm in the evening, and weekend usage is spread throughout the middle of the day. Also there is a low-usage time in the early morning of every day of the week.

7. Below heatmap shows that userbase is dominated by male-identifying, subscribing users.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, bike-sharing program are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas and the most of the users are male subscribers. In addition, I would like to explore below additional visualizations with the given dataset.

1. Average trip duration by birth year and by gender to consider the factor of age.
2. Find the top starting locations and top ending locations during peak hours to find the flow of traffic at peak hours.
